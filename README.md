# Objective : To translate a design from Figma into a functional HTML/CSS webpage with form validation using JavaScript.

 Followed web standards, accessibility principles.

 Ensured usage of semantic HTML5 elements, pixel-perfect design and responsiveness across multiple devices.

 Implemented validation through vanilla javascript levaraging regular expressions without limiting to html basic validation. 

 Leveraged DOM manipulation methods to toggle classes, add or remove feedback messages to form elements.

 Check console (control+shift+j for windows or Cmd + Option + J for mac) to view the form data after you successfully submit it.
